- 👋 Hi, I’m @Kwynto. My real name is Constantine Zavezeon. I'm from Russia.
- 👀 I have been interested in programming for a very long time. I had to write in many programming languages, but now I settled on the GoLang.
- 🌱 I am very good and fast at learning programming languages, but I am very bad at learning natural languages. Now I'm trying to learn English, but I still don't know English very well.
- 💞️ I accept proposals for participation in open source projects, as well as willing to accept job offers.
- 📫 You can contact me by e-mail: kwynto@mail.ru  
- :-) I ask potential employers to read [my wishes](https://github.com/Kwynto/Kwynto/blob/main/offer.md).

*You can support the development of open source and my projects with any amount in Bitcoins.*

**P.S.1:** *Programming is a pleasure. Initiation into the mystery of coding is excellent in itself. Programming is like a flash of feelings and can only be compared to ecstasy.*

**P.S.2:** *ProfanITy. The most used language in programming.*
